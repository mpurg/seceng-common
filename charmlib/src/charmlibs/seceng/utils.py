    """Securely open a file for writing.

    This code may run as root and needs to safely create files in locations
    owned by a non-privileged user. That means the non-privileged user must not
    be able to influence the file creation in locations it does not control.

    If the user parameter is set to a username that does not translate to UID
    0, that user must not be able to influence the execution of this code
    running with privileges to override a file path that is not writable by the
    user.

    If the user parameter is not set, any non-privileged user must not be able
    to influence the execution of this code running with privileges to override
    a file path that is not writable by the user.

    The value of the input file path is assumed to be trusted, but can refer to
    a file owned by a non-trusted user or with components owned by a
    non-trusted user (e.g. /home/bad-user/filename).

    The function never follows the last component of the path as a symlink
    - it gets replaced by a new regular file that is rename()d over in the last
      directory component of the path.

    Restrictions:
      - The parent paths are owned by UID 0 followed by, optionally the user
        passed as an argument.
      - Directories owned by UID 0 are not writable by any other user (unless
        sticky bit is set).

    Assumptions:
      - Directories owned by root do not have filesystem ACLs (not enforced).
      - Hardlink protections are enabled (sysctl fs.protected_hardlinks, not
        enforced).
      - A root-owned symlink will not be pointing to a user-controlled path.

    Each directory component of the path can contain parameters after a '!'
    character, which affect the creation of that directory:
      - mode=X - the directory is created with the specified mode (as octal);
        defaults to 700
      - uid - the directory owner is changed to the user specified as an
        argument to the function, after creation
      - gid - the directory group is changed to the group specified as an
        argument to the function, after creation

    If a directory exists, its mode and owner/group are not changed.

    For example, if the path is /var/lib/foo!mode=710,gid/bar!uid,gid/baz:
      - /var and /var/lib and created as owned by root:root and with mode 700
        (although they would normally exist).
      - /var/lib/foo is created as owned by root:group with mode 710.
      - /var/lib/foo/bar is created as owned by user:group with mode 700.
      - The file baz is created under /var/lib/foo/bar according to the rest of
        the function parameters.
